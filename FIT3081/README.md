# FIT3081 ASSGN
## Objective:
A group project where we were asked to design and implement a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system using a model trained on the cifar10 training dataset. The model's performance will be evaluated to ensure it achieves the desired accuracy level. The system will then be equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to submit a set of images for retrieval. The system will retrieve 4-5 images from the trained image set that are similar to the submitted images and display them on the user's screen.
## Skill Acquired:
Matlab programming, Image Processing, Machine learning, Data Analysis, Problem Solving, GUI Design, etc.
## Dataset:
CIFAR 10 dataset
# NOTE:
The project in this folder were made possible through the support and resources provided by Monash University Malaysia.
